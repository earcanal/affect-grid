# Affect Grid

This is the [Affect Grid](https://earcanal.github.io/affect-grid/) for use in the [Experiment Factory](https://expfactory.github.io/expfactory).

You can run it locally by putting these files in a web server, or use the Experiment Factory to generate a reproducible container.

## Processing Data in R

There's an associated **alpha** `R` package for processing the data generated by the Affect Grid. This will happen in continuous integration, and you can run manually like this:

```
bash
cd expfactory.affectgrid
R -e 'devtools::install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)'
R -e 'devtools::check()'
R -e 'devtools::test()'
```

### Installation

```
library(devtools)
install_github('earcanal/affect-grid/expfactory.affectgrid')
```
